	<h2 class="title"> The four main categories of ramen </h2>
	 
	   <h4>Shoyu Ramen</h4>

	   <p>
		Shoyu ramen is defined by its characteristic inclusion of shoyu, or soy sauce, in the broth. This is a varied ramen type, as the broth can be made from
		   any type of base, from bones to vegetables and everything in between. The addition of soy sauce lends its trademark savory and salty taste.
	   </p>
	 
		<h4>Shio Ramen</h4>
		<img src="images/shio-ramen.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" alt="Picture of shio ramen with a chicken bone base.">
		<p>Shio ramen takes a lighter route than the shoyu ramen by using salt, typically sea salt, as it's flavoring base. Because the job of the chef is to showcase
		   the salt's delicate flavor profile, a lighter broth base is typically used. Chicken bones or vegetable bases are good options here, as they lend themselves
		   to a lighter flavor.
		</p>

		<h4>Miso Ramen</h4>
		<img src="images/miso-ramen.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" alt="Picture of miso ramen featuring typical local toppings.">
		<p>Miso ramen is a favorite of Hokkaido, in northern Japan. It features miso paste as its main flavoring component. Miso paste is made from fermented soybeans
		   that are then ground. Miso provides a complex, balanced taste that is usually paired with complementary, but lighter, base broths. This is so the taste of 
		   the miso can come to the forefront and build upon the broth for a unique experience.
		</p>
	 
		<h4>Tonkotsu Ramen</h4>
		<img src="images/tonkotsu-ramen.jpg" width="400px" height="300px" alt="Picture of typical tonkotsu ramen, noted for its rich meaty taste and milky white appearance.">
		<p>Tonkotsu ramen is different from the other 3 in that it describes the base rather than the source of salt used to flavor the broth. Tonkotsu is made by 
		   boiling pork bones that have a lot of natural connective tissue for many hours, to break down and gelatinize that tissue which produces a thick, creamy
		   broth that is often opaque and milky white in appearance. Tonkotsu can be flavored with anything, but soy sauce is most common.
